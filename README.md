# Week Two Rails Application

## Requirements

* [ ] Clone the Rails application, run: `bundle`, `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate`.
* [ ] Generate a `PagesController` with pages `home`, `profile`, and `news`.
* [ ] Map the `home` action in the `PagesController` to the root path.
* [ ] Customize routes for pages so they don't have `/pages/` in the URL path.
* [ ] Install `Devise gem` and follow instructions from the Documentation to implement authentication.
  - When running the command `rails generate devise MODEL`, replace `MODEL` with `Admin`.      
* [ ] Implement a view helper for authentication links on all pages.
